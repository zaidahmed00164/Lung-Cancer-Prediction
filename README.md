Lung Cancer Prediction using KNN and Decision Tree

Overview

This project implements a machine learning approach to predict lung cancer based on given patient data. The dataset includes features such as Age, Smoking Habits, and Alcohol Consumption. Two machine learning models are used for classification:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

The project evaluates both models using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
